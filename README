terco - terminal colors
-----------------------

A small and potentially growing collection of terminal colors, saved for future
reference or use. The colorschemes are formatted for Xresources.


usage
-----

Clone the repo to e.g. `~/terco`

Include the desired colorscheme in your `~/.Xresources`

Example:

    $ #include "terco/matte"


contributing
------------

Pull requests to extend the collection are always welcome. I will not lay forth
any personal opinion concerning particular colors in a colorscheme. This means
that any PR will immediately be included in the collection, provided that it
adheres to the structure of existing colorschemes.

In other words - PR away. I encourage you to.
