terco - terminal colors
=======================

A small and potentially growing collection of terminal colorschemes, saved for
future reference or use. The colorschemes are formatted for Xresources.


Usage
-----

Clone the repo to e.g. `~/terco`

Include the desired colorscheme in your `~/.Xresources`:

    #include "terco/colorschemes/waffles"

Then run:

    $ xrdb ~/.Xresources

Spawn a new terminal and you should see the effect.


Contributing
------------

Pull requests to extend the collection are always welcome. I will not lay forth
any personal opinion concerning particular colors in a colorscheme. This means
that any PR will immediately be included in the collection, provided that it
adheres to the structure of existing colorschemes.

In other words - PR away. I encourage you to.
